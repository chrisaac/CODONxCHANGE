# CODONxCHANGE
Bioinformatics software to test the limits of genetic recoding and biosecurity
This software was developed for the 2017 Lethbridge iGEM Team and consists of three tools:
1. GRecoS
2. SeCReT
3. DeToxIT

All tools are written in Python 2.7 and run from the command line. 
First make sure that you have Python installed to your machine.
Instructions can be found at: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)

To use the tools, navigate to the source directory and input the following command:
'''
python TOOLNAME.py
'''
for a trial run of the software. Input parameters are specific for each tool.

## GRecoS
### Genetic Recoding Space
Usage:
'''
python GRecoS.py <number of nucleotides> <length of codon> <number of amino acids>
'''

## SeCReT
### Sequential Codon Reassignment Tool
Usage:
'''
python TOOLNAME.py <input protein sequence>
'''

## DeToxIT
### Decryption and Toxin Identification Tool
Usage:
'''
python TOOLNAME.py <input DNA or protein sequence> 
'''
